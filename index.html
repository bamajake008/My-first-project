                <h2>DUMBEST MOMENT</h2>
                <p>We've all done something just completely..... just... goofy! Well, one time I was with friends and
                    decided
                    it would be a great idea to
                    go car surfing. I got on the roof of the car, my friend floored it, and BAM!!! He slammed the brakes
                    shortly after. I hit the gravel, was torn up from my hip to shoulder,
                    and broke my collar bone!

                    has been my daughter for sure. I was an absolute mess before her.
                    She pushes me to be the best me that I can possibly be.
